Project Overview:

The goal of this project was to create a comprehensive MS Excel dashboard for analyzing sales data. The provided dataset included various columns such as OrderDate, Month, Region, City, Category, Product, Quantity, UnitPrice, TotalPrice, and Salesperson. By leveraging this data, the project aimed to gain insights into sales performance, trends, and key metrics.

The dashboard consisted of several components:

Graph 1: Sales by Month (Line with Markers graph)

This graph displayed the sales trends over different months, enabling the identification of patterns and seasonality in sales data.
Graph 2: Sales by Salesperson (Clustered graph)

This graph allowed for a comparison of sales performance among different salespersons, providing insights into their individual contributions to overall sales.
Pie Chart 1: Percentage of Sales by Category (2D Pie Chart)

This pie chart visualized the distribution of sales across various categories, highlighting the relative contribution of each category to total sales.
Pie Chart 2: Percentage of Sales by City (2D Pie Chart)

This pie chart illustrated the proportion of sales attributed to different cities, helping identify the cities with the highest sales volumes.
Pivot Table 5: Quantity of Product

This pivot table summarized the quantity of each product sold, allowing for a quick overview of product sales volume.
Project Summary:

In summary, this project aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of sales data through the creation of an MS Excel dashboard. By leveraging graphs, pie charts, and pivot tables, the dashboard provided insights into sales trends, salesperson performance, category distribution, city-wise sales, and product quantity. The visualizations offered stakeholders the ability to make informed decisions and identify areas for improvement in sales strategies, product offerings, and target markets. The dataset served as the foundation for extracting meaningful insights and generating actionable recommendations.
